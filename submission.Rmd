## Introduction
Deciding between man and zone coverage is one of the most critical strategic choices a defensive coordinator must make before each offensive play in American football. While experienced offensive coordinators and quarterbacks often rely on visual cues to identify these defensive schemes, the increasing availability of player tracking data offers a new avenue to uncover and analyze these tactics. A notable example is Amazon's NFL Next Gen Stats model, which delivers predictions during live broadcasts (see a snapshot of the 2024 Week 12 matchup between the Pittsburgh Steelers and Cleveland Browns. These predictions, however, seem to be, from a viewership's assessment, limited to specific plays without incorporating pre-snap motion which is a crucial element of modern offensive strategies. `r colorize("Ich weiß nicht, ob ich das so formulieren würde... Wir wissen nicht was deren Modell alles inkludiert. Es kann gut sein, dass sie auch tracking und daher auch premotion Daten nehmen. Oder glaubst Du ist das eine Expertise von einer Person mit domain knowledge und kein statistisches Modell? Rouven: Ne glaube das ist ein stat. Modell aber habe mir ein paar Szenen angeschaut und da kam die Prediction eigentlich immer nur wenn sich keiner bewegte.","red")`  

Our project takes this model a step further. While we similarly predict man or zone coverage when the teams are set, we further leverage the additional information of pre-snap player movements. Using a hidden Markov model (HMM), we model defenders' trajectories based on hidden states, which represent the offensive players they may be guarding. This probabilistic approach allows us to infer dynamic coverage patterns during plays with pre-snap motion. To exploit this high-dimensional time-series data, we calculate the entropy of the state probabilities, thus, producing measures of uncertainty for each play. Incorporating these as covariates into the existing pre-motion model significantly improves both the AUC and detection accuracy. 

In doing so, we present a data-driven framework that evaluates the effectiveness of pre-snap motion in uncovering defensive strategies, providing real-time tactical insights for coaches.

## Data
We analyze tracking data from nine weeks of the NFL 2022 season, provided by the NFL Big Data Bowl 2024. Beside the tracking data, we also use information on plays and players. We further considered the corresponding data from PFF that assigned the categories \textit{man}, \textit{zone} and \textit{others} representing the different schemes to each play. As it is not properly described what \textit{others} means, we omit every play that is associated with this value. Moreover, we omit plays with more than five offensive linemen and with two quarterbacks and those plays that did not contain any pre-snap motion. Then, we end up with XY offensive plays in total, from which the defense played Y in zone and X in man coverage. 

Within these plays, we concentrate on the tracking data after the line has been set (because we are not interested in how players come out of the huddle) and before the ball has been snapped by the Center. 

##### Feature engineering
To accurately forecast the defensive scheme (man- or zone defense) for every play, we need to create various features derived from the tracking data. In particular, we conducted the following feature engineering steps: We first consider all 11 players on each side of the field and compute features related to the convex hull of the positions of the players. In particular, for defense and offense, we compute the area spanned by the convex hull of all player such as well as the largest $y$ distance (i.e.\ the width of the hull) and the largest $x$ distance (i.e. the length of the hull). In addition, we select the five most relevant players on each side of the field. For offense, we omit the offensive line and the QB, while, for defense, we omit nose tackles, defensive tackles and defensive ends, and select the five defenders that were the closest to the five attackers corresponding to a weighted euclidean distance, putting much more emphasis on the y-axis. Finally, we use their standardized $x$ and $y$ coordinates as covariates and order defensive and offensive players according to their $y$ coordinates.. (`r colorize("Distances, orientation?? Appenix?? Rouven: würde sagen ja","red")`)

\textbf{UMSCHREIBEN} \textit{For all players and the ball carrier we use the features already contained in the tracking data, namely x- and y-coordinates, speed, acceleration, distance covered, orientation and direction. Except for the ball carrier we further compute the euclidean distance, x-distance and y-distance to the ball carrier. For defensive players only, we additionally compute the absolute difference of the defender’s direction and the angle of the shortest segment between the defender and the ball carrier. Subsequently, we order all players (in each frame) with respect to their euclidean distance to the ball carrier and standardize all features.
More details regarding data pre-processing can be found in the Appendix.}

## Analysis 

Our analysis comprises different steps:

#### 1. Pre-motion prediction
We train different models (LASSO, Random Forest, XGBoost) to predict whether the defense plays a man- or zone coverage scheme. In particular, .....

The model uses the previously described features, blablabla.

#### 2. Hidden Markov model
We describe the movements of the five defensive players during the phase of pre-snap motion within a hidden Markov model (see the Appendix for a thorough description). In particular, we assume the defender's $y$-coordinates in each time step $t$ to be realizations of Gaussian distributions with means according to the $y$-coordinates of the offensive players to be guarded (these are the underlying states) and a standard deviation to be estimated (see Franks et al. 2015 for a similar approach in basketball).

The results of the HMM are exemplified using the following video. It displays a touchdown from the Kansas City Chiefs against the Arizona Cardinals in Week 1 of the 2022 NFL season. We can see that, pre-snap, Mecole Hardman (KC #17) is in motion. He is immediately followed by the defender Marco Wilson (AZ #20), which is a clear indication for man-coverage.

#### 3. Post-motion prediction
We re-train the pre-motion model to predict whether the defense plays a man- or zone coverage scheme, however, in this step, we incorporate results from the HMM analysis as further covariates. In particular, we include the state-switching probabilities....

To remediate this, we derive the decision of man- or zone coverage from the number of switches for individual players. In particular, a low number of switches when offensive players are in motion indicates man coverage whereas a higher number indicates zone coverage.

## Results

By comparing the predictive performance of our model without motion and our post-motion model we can determine the effectiveness of player movements before the snap to detect the correct defensive scheme. Moreover, we assess which teams predominantly apply pre-snap motions to increase the likelihood of correctly identifying the applied defensive strategy.

## Discussion

One limitation of our approach lies in the imperfect prediction accuracy of the pre-motion model, primarily due to insufficient hyperparameter tuning and the relatively small number of plays involving motion. However, the primary focus of this project was on pre-snap motion, particularly on how to effectively translate this information into the hidden Markov model. Importantly, our pre-motion model is modular and can be seamlessly replaced by another model, such as the NFL Next Gen Stats model, which can then be integrated into our modeling extension to fully leverage the insights provided by pre-snap motion.

## Appendix

#### Hidden Markov Model
A hidden Markov models consists of an observed time series $\{\boldsymbol{y}_t\}_{t=1}^T$ --- here, the y-coordinates of the defensive players and an unobserved first-order Markov chain $\{ g_t\}_{t=1}^T$, with $g_t \in \{1,\ldots,N\}$ which proxies the offensives players to be guarded at every time point $t$. The Markov chain is fully described by an initial distribution $\boldsymbol{\delta}=\bigl( \Pr(g_1=1), \ldots, \Pr(g_1=N) \bigr)$ and a transition probability matrix (t.p.m.) $\boldsymbol{\Gamma} = (\gamma_{ij}),$ with $\gamma_{ij} = \Pr(g_t = j| g_{t-1} = i), \ i,j = 1, \ldots, N$. The connection of both stochastic processes arises from the assumption that the distribution of the observations $\boldsymbol{y}_t$ are fully determined by the currently active state, i.e.\ 
\begin{equation*}
f(\boldsymbol{y}_t|g_1, \ldots, g_T, \boldsymbol{y}_1, \ldots, \boldsymbol{y}_{t-1},\boldsymbol{y}_{t+1},\ldots,\boldsymbol{y}_T) = f(\boldsymbol{y}_t|g_t).
\end{equation*}
In general, $f$ can be any density or probability mass function depending on the type of data. Following the approaches of Franks et al. (2015), we opt for a Gaussian distribution.
